# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
This project is a lightweight face recognition-based attendance tracker that captures real-time video from your webcam, detects known faces using deep learning-based embeddings, and logs attendance with a timestamp. Built using Python, OpenCV, the face_recognition library, this system is ideal for classrooms, small offices, or personal projects.
